(*
 * Think about it:
 * very powerfull type system (more abilities to express) can lead to
 * overcomplicated solutions .. like Haskell "callback hell wrapped in do
 * notation and type-checked"
 * Whereas less powerful (exmp: C#) can lead to mo simple (maybe more 
 * boilerplate) less "elegant" ... but eventually better solution
