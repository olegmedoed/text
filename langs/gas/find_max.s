# This program is directed by data. Depending on what data it receives, it will
# follow different instruction paths.

# Even though they are .long, the program will produce strange results if any 
# number is greater than 255, because thatâ€™s the largest allowed exit status

# %edi - current position in the list.
# %ebx - current highest value in the list.
# %eax - current element being examined.
# [from me] but instead edi I can use edx[for exmp]
.section .data
# .long causes the assembler to reserve memory for the list of nums that follow
# it. data_items refers to the location of the first one. Because data_items is
# a label, any time in our program where we need to refer to this address we can
# use the data_items symbol, and the gas will substitute it with the address
# where the numbers start during assembly.

# We don't have a .globl declaration for data_items. This is because we only
# refer to these locations within the program
data_items:
# .byte   numbers between 0 and 255.        1b
# .word   numbers between 0 and 65535.      2b
# .long   numbers between 0 and 4294967295. 4b (.short .int may be varied)
# .ascii  string of bytes in ascii format "\tHello world!\n\0"
.long 223,67,34,222,45,75,54,34,44,33,22,11,66,0 # 0 is a list terminator
