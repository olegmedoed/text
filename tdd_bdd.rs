// In tests you should describe/test the things which is crucial for your module/class/etc, which
// is mostly UNCHANGED(that is you don't need usually to change(exactly, i'm not mean refactoring)
// your test)
// It's opposed to how I write in ruby:
for meth in ["save", "fuck", "police"] {
    it("should has method #${meth}", || self.should_respond_to(meth); ) // << Type-system for poors
}
// In such case we loose the power of dynamic language, since like in Rust every refactor/change to

// in `test-run` the only things that affect on the test-execution ,. IS .. what the

/// - result of test should be **uniquely** determined by input data what

// exmp: if you need for your test a Date, you need prepare instance of Date and

// be not arbitrary value, BUT controlled by you .. SO .. you can control state of

//! DELETED: about tests with "CreditCards", it's ALL ABOUT:

//!                     *******************
//!
//  v-- about: when you pass all your fun-dependencies explicitly (particularly in CONSTRUCTOR)

// AFAIU:   TESTABILITY of program depends of the fact how much fns in the program relies on the
// INPUT/OUTPUT (that is programm written in (mostly) fun-style). If you read ##9 post (inspired
// by Miwko from Angular) you notice that for testability it's good to make dependency injections:
///     ^-- HAVE NO MUT_ALIASING, and even if "fn" mutate someting, if it receive it AS MUTABLE
///     PARAMETER aka "&mut _", IT'S EXPLICIT PASSING OF CAPABILITY TO DO SIDE_EFF(here mutation)
//         (Bll99: ^-- I wrote it even before "IDEPMOTENCE"-FunLight stuff was learnt)
// BUT:
// 1. don't depend on MUT global state. (=> explicitness)
// 2. don't set the properties of objects(that is treat it as a value(in term of Hickey))
///  ^-- (2) absence of implicit and !uncontrolled by tester! "side-effects",
///                                                           configuration-by-mutation
// So .. it let us EASILY PREPARE the input data for test AND .. BE SURE that its execution not
// depends of other factors,  ... SO this let's ensure --v (i copy-past it from ##9)
/// - there is should be not external(global) factors
/// - order of testS execution should not matter
/// - result of test should be **uniquely** determined by input data which `test-driver`(our test)

// About testing meths what receive ACDE.
// If we test the meth, which receive ACDE, as I belive we should test(as ANY fn) in/out rel, and
// (the GIST) side-effs, BUT, if for exmp ..
fn some_meth<T: AbstType>(a: T) -> SomeType { a.do_something() }
// .. how we know whether `do_something` is doing side-eff in some implementation of AbstType or
// not, that is maybe some impl of AbstType do some side-eff, and other doesn't ..(in Hskl we can
// know it)
// WAS {
//      maybe we should use "should_receive", "receive_with().and_return()" for ACDE
// } BECOMEs {
//      1. NAHUI "spies".
//      2. Eventualy, every ACDE passed as arg, return some concrete type as res of one of its
//         meths, SO, just STUB it, and return this type .. IF even.. ACDE::meth return another
//         ACDE (which is rare key), just STUB it.
//         .. and ..
//         in unit-tests we don't care about side-eff except :lol: "EXCEPTIONs"(in Rust it's steel
//         IN/OUT), leave other side-effs to INTEGRATION tests (## 24 .. here test_user_saving is
//         formally unit-test, but actually INTEGRATION (with REAL DBAdapter) test).
// }
///                                 after a year
///  Man, you need understand that implementation behind ACDE may DO, but may NOT DO any side-eff
///  for exmp you accept "abstract renderer" (remember DesPatter "Maze" exmp [AFAIRememb "Builder"

//!      Then  "I have such_and_such side-eff and fun-ret-vals"

// TDD doesn't prevents BUGs, don't fool yourself, you are not a TESTER, and only REAL PRODUCTION
// can show all your bugs (after some time) .. spent this time to write actual code, and fix bugs
// NOTE: I'm write TDD-tests, NOT TDD, since the key point, that Dynamic langs, gives you
// flexibility and ability quickly write(prototype) you programm WITHOUT STRICT INTERFACES (which
// can event track side-eff in Hskl and Rust(partially)) .. NOT in "Right" way, BUT in
// "***simple implementation first" way, so when you try meticulously describe all your (behavior)
// side-eff (and types/interfaces), and so on in tests ..
// WE ELIMINATE ADVANTAGES of Dynamic lang, since you "cementiruete" programm "behavior" in tests
// and.. ANY AGILE/FAST change to program-DESIGN (what is PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT on "prototype"
// or "early-designing" phase), MAKE US REWRITE our unit-tests(IF WE HAVE TOO MUCH OF THEM)
// .... also: TDD-test(as opposed to TDD) is not used for "constant/instant feedback"(as KentBack
// suggest), it's about "cheking your KEY-POINTs, the MAIN LOGIC of your app". 
// ..
// So in TDD-tests you should describe only EMPHASIZED  by you side-effs or states(MAIN LOGIC),
// which should serve like "INVARIANTS", what let you be sure that main KEY POINT of your programm
// is correct, AND LOCALIZE A FUTURE BUGs .. since..
/// Dijkstra: "testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!"
// So... you write TDD-test to show absance bugs in MAIN behaviour ..
// .. like Dimon said that he not completely agree with TDD-is-DEAD(and E.Meijer), since:
//  "if not tests, I could not be sure that some one when add new feature( or fixes something)
//  not break my code (while I was on leave), but since I have a test, I can run them, and be sure that
//  GENERALLY( KEY-POINTs ) it's all OK".
// .. So..
// ... He appreciate TDD-test because of .. if some one add new feature, or make some changes to
// code it can still be sure that MAIN INVARIANT'S (MAIN LOGIC OF YOUR PROGRAM) doesn't broken,
// and if QA file a bug, it can run test, and if it see that INVARIANTs is not broken , then he
// quickly can skip this cases, and "localize" the search.
// ..
// ... SO.. we write TDD-test to make sure that key points of our funcs JUST WORK, like I do it
// with fns in REPL.
///     ^-- FUCK: in the way they help you LOCALIZE BUGs.
// ... and since Rust haven't REPL - it's the only way to do such testing in
// Rust - write TDD-tests, just make sure that our fn works in the way we expected ..
// NOT it has not bugs. ...
///                 P.S (after year [autumn-2017])
///     Actually it's pretty good integr/unit (INVESTIGATION )test ... which capture MAIN behavior

    }
}
//                  `````
// ... Gives us NOTHING .. since I DON'T EVEN TRY TO TEST IT IN REPL .. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT I CALL
// "SAVE" .. the only thing to test it .. is result of Builder .. BUT it's tests for Builder ..
///     ^--  BUT WHAT IF SOME ONE "break"  Builder .. you in BIG-ORGANIZATION with ~55-devs??

// ... So, maybe it's makes sense to use SOMETIMES STUBs when call external "service" is too

//      .. . it's mix of QA tests + TDD tests ....

//      TDD test sholud not just test your function (you programmer, NOT QA) .. but express

//          ..
//              ... and tada ... SUCK TESTs   .. MAYBE ... we can use as (addtion) means of
//          investigation
//          ..
//          Especialy in cases when you see some (some degree complex) fuction .... and instead

///          .. you wanna just see (general piceture :lol:) side effects what this function produce.
///         in company with "purposes"(exxp: it("PURPOSES HERE", () => {Sideeffs here}))
//              note: here "mocks" can be poor choice and INTEGRATION tests is COOL ...
///             BUT
///         because test in OSS mix TDD + QA .... it's just became "crappy reading"

// About inject dependency (DI) everywhere to make code more testable, encourage modularity....

// .. SO: imagine that you don't let "overusing-DI" everywhere just to have ability
